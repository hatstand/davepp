This file is for *low* priority things; things that would
otherwise fall through the cracks and get forgotten about

Cosmetic/UI changes:
- display slots info in the userlist; actually, better would be a 
  simple colour change to indicate free slots vs. no free slots
- ETA download finish; in general clean up the current download 
  widget, it's got too many things displayed at the same time: 
  Prioritize.
- Implement /me stuff
- Pie in the sky: for each person in the user list, it does an 
  nslookup of their IP address, takes the crsid (if present), enters 
  it into lookup.cam.ac.uk, then enters the surname and college into 
  facebook and displays their photo next to their username
