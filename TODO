This file is for *low* priority things; things that would
otherwise fall through the cracks and get forgotten about

Cosmetic/UI changes:
- display slots info in the userlist; actually, better would be a 
  simple colour change to indicate free slots vs. no free slots
- ETA download finish; in general clean up the current download 
  widget, it's got too many things displayed at the same time: 
  Prioritize.
- Implement /me stuff; should refactor out the message display code
- Refactor out the escape code for outputting chat messages; see above
